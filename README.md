# Website Testing with Java and WebDriver

## Overview

This repository contains a Java project for automated testing of the "Links" website using WebDriver. The tests are designed using the Page Object Model (POM) and follow the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Cross-browser testing is achieved with WebDriverManager, making it easy to run tests on different browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for test automation.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.
- **WebDriverManager**: Simplifies the management of WebDriver binaries for different browsers.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework for organizing and running tests.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern for organizing test code into page-specific classes.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests are designed to run on various browsers for maximum compatibility.
